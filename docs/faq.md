## There's a "v2" or "v3" in the top-left of the board, what does it mean?

This is, as you probably guessed, how I version the different revisions of the board.

### v1

While there was technically a v1 board, it wasn't labelled as such and was never distributed to anyone. I made a silly mistake in the design which rendered it totally inoperable. So all it does is sit there and look cool.

### v2

If you find yourself in possession of a v2 board, congratulations! There were only ever 5 of these made, and only 2 of them were preassembled. This version has a defect where the decoupling capacitor for the Neopixels were connected inline with the circuit instead of to ground. You may notice a solder bridge where the capacitor is supposed to be.

### v3

v3 is the current version of the board, and fixes the capacitor issue mentioned in v2. It also adjusts the silkscreen so that the words "Software Engineer" and the QR Code don't overlap with the pads for the headers.
